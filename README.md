## Procedure:
### 1. Identify and Select Test Use Cases
Choose specific domains where AI assistance is commonly required:

#### Selection Criteria for Test Cases:

- Relevance to business and academic applications
- Varying complexity levels (from simple to complex)
- Representation of both factual and creative tasks
- Coverage of common professional use cases
- Tasks that require different forms of reasoning (analytical, creative, etc.)

### 2. Design Multi-level Test Prompts
Create standardized prompt sets with increasing complexity:
#### Level 1: Basic Prompts
Simple, straightforward instructions to establish baseline performance.
Example: "Summarize the key benefits of cloud computing in 3-4 bullet points."
#### Level 2: Context-Rich Prompts
Prompts that provide background information and specific requirements.
Example: "You're preparing notes for a meeting with a client who's considering migrating from on-premise servers to cloud solutions. Write a brief comparison highlighting security, cost, and scalability factors. The client works in healthcare and is concerned about HIPAA compliance."
#### Level 3: Complex Multi-part Prompts
Prompts requiring multiple interconnected tasks or reasoning steps.
Example: "Analyze the Python code snippet below. 1) Identify any bugs or inefficiencies, 2) Suggest optimizations with examples, 3) Explain how the time complexity would change with your improvements, and 4) Recommend testing approaches to verify correctness."

### 3. Response Evaluation Framework
Assess each platform's outputs using a standardized 5-point scale across key dimensions:
#### Accuracy (1-5)

- 5: Flawless, with zero factual errors or misleading statements
- 3: Generally accurate with minor issues
- 1: Significant factual errors or hallucinations

#### Completeness (1-5)

- 5: Addresses all aspects of the prompt comprehensively
- 3: Covers main points but misses nuances
- 1: Substantially incomplete or off-topic

#### Clarity & Structure (1-5)

- 5: Exceptionally well-organized with logical flow and clear sections
- 3: Adequately organized but with some structural issues
- 1: Disorganized, difficult to follow

#### Adaptability (1-5)

- 5: Perfectly adapts to specified tone, format, and audience
- 3: Some adaptation but with inconsistencies
- 1: Ignores format/tone requirements

#### Technical Depth (1-5)

- 5: Expert-level understanding with nuanced insights
- 3: Competent explanation at intermediate level
- 1: Superficial or incorrect technical content

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40fd6314-834f-4783-a5be-015145c7ee4d)

Alternatively, we can use an even more memory-efficient solution:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29eb3e1f-06ed-47d8-89ba-5688a5e3b57e)

### Performance Improvement Analysis
#### Time Complexity

- Original: O(2^n) - exponential time
- Optimized: O(n) - linear time

For context, calculating fibonacci(50):

- Original: ~2^50 operations (over 1 quadrillion)
- Optimized: Only 50 operations

#### Space Complexity

- Original: O(n) stack space due to recursion
- DP solution: O(n) heap space for the array
- Iterative solution: O(1) constant space

#### Big O Improvement
The optimization transforms an exponential algorithm into a linear one - this is one of the most dramatic complexity improvements possible, reducing computation time from practically impossible to instant for large inputs.
Why This Matters
For fibonacci(30):

- Original: ~2.5 million recursive calls
- Optimized: Just 30 simple operations

The original function calls itself twice for each non-base case, creating a binary tree of recursive calls that grows exponentially with n. The optimized version simply builds the solution incrementally, storing only what's needed.

#### Meta LLaMA Response:
Performance Review of Fibonacci Function
The provided recursive function has significant performance issues:

- Time Complexity: O(2^n) - exponential time complexity due to multiple redundant recursive calls
- Redundant Calculations: Each value is recalculated many times
- Stack Usage: Deep recursion can cause stack overflow for large n

#### Optimized Version:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5779e592-9d65-419d-b489-ee592f3056a9)

#### Explanation:

This iterative solution has O(n) time complexity - linear instead of exponential
Uses constant O(1) space instead of O(n) stack space
Avoids redundant calculations by storing only the two most recent values

For perspective, calculating fibonacci(40):

- Original: Makes over 200 million recursive calls
- Optimized: Makes exactly 40 iterations

The performance difference becomes exponentially larger as n increases. The original solution becomes unusable even for moderately large inputs.
Big O Analysis:

- Original: O(2^n) time, O(n) space
- Optimized: O(n) time, O(1) space

This optimization demonstrates how algorithmic improvements can be far more impactful than any hardware improvements.
